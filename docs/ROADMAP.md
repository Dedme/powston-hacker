# Roadmap (Draft)

## Phase 1: MVP (rules + versioning)
- Create and edit rule templates in split-section format.
- Git-like DAG versioning with branches and diffs.
- Compile/merge into a single Powston-compatible Python file.
- Powston validation via check_code/test_code/sim_code.
- Monaco editor, diff view, and basic rule list UI.

## Phase 2: Shared templates repository
- Public/private template marketplace.
- Template rating, reviews, and download/import.
- Curated starter templates and change notes.

## Phase 3: User Params UI & macro system

## Phase 4: Helper registry and search
- Shared helper library, discoverable and versioned.
- Search by function name, signature, tags, and usage.
- One-click import into rules.

## Phase 5: Multi-rule management
- Rule sets with shared helpers and params.
- Import from other templates/rules.
- Clone and fork flows.

## Phase 6: AI assistant
- In-editor AI chat to suggest or apply code updates.
- Automated refactors and parameter tuning suggestions.

## Phase 7: Advanced validation and insights
